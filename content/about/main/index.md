intro: |
  Allow me to introduce myself—I'm Saddam Hussein, a passionate geospatial analyst and evangelist, remote sensing specialist, and a wildlife conservationist.
  
  With a decade of experience in GIS, remote sensing, and cartography, I've had the privilege of working with a diverse range of geospatial data. From analyzing satellite imagery to utilizing cutting-edge software like ArcGIS, eCognition Developer, and ENVI, as well as mastering open-source tools like QGIS, R programming, and Google Earth Engine, I've honed my skills in geospatial data analysis.
  
  Since 2016, I've been fortunate enough to contribute my expertise to [a non-profit organization focused on wildlife conservation](https://indonesia.wcs.org/). Over the past few years, I've immersed myself in the realm of ecological modeling and species distribution analysis, using statistical techniques and the versatile R programming language. Through this work, I've gained valuable insights into protected area patrol data, biodiversity monitoring, and human-wildlife conflict data, collected since 2008.
  
  In my current role as a senior coordinator in a data and knowledge management unit, I ensure that every piece of field data is accurately collected and meticulously transformed into actionable information. It's immensely fulfilling to witness how this knowledge supports our organization in evaluating and planning effective conservation strategies.
  
  Outside of my professional endeavors, I take pleasure in sharing my geospatial expertise [through engaging writings](/blogs). I belief that a broader understanding of geospatial data and analysis can greatly benefit individuals across various fields and areas of expertise. I am convinced that embracing geospatial insights is crucial for fostering harmony between humans, nature, and the creation of a sustainable environment, ultimately leading to a better world.
