### Sumatra Wide Tiger Survey II

The Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) is the smallest and darkest tiger subspecies, and it is the only remaining island tiger in Indonesia. It strongly prefers uncultivated forests and makes little use of plantations, even if they are available. The Sumatran tiger is critically endangered. It faces threats such as poaching, deforestation, and conflict with humans. Conservation efforts, including the protection of its habitat and population monitoring, are being undertaken to support the survival of this species.

In July 2018, the Government of Indonesia and NGO partners initiated the second Sumatra Wide Tiger Survey (SWTS) to reassess the island-wide status of the Sumatran tiger. SWTS is a collaborative program involving the government, non-governmental organizations, and private entities to conduct a survey of the Sumatran tiger's habitat and assess its population trends in the wild.

##### "The SWTS 2018-2019 is the world's largest wildlife survey in terms of partnerships, human resources involved, and survey area. A total of 74 survey teams (354 team members) from 30 institutions were deployed to conduct surveys in 23 tiger distribution areas covering 12.9 million hectares, with 6.4 million hectares of it being habitat surveyed during the first SWTS."
