## Geospasialis

The vision of this website is to provide accurate and up-to-date information about the geospatial world, including spatial data and analysis, cartography and maps, as well as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing in Bahasa Indonesia.

As it evolves, this website also features articles on statistics, data analysis, and machine learning.

A specific goal of this website is for me to learn the art of Search Engine Optimization (SEO), blog management, article creation, and to achieve top rankings on Google search results.

This website has achieved its goal, with its articles ranking at the top and appearing on the Google's search engine first page for various key words such as "uji akurasi klasifikasi citra," "uji hipotesis", "analisis overlay","citra penginderaan jauh", "generalisasi peta", "inset peta", "komponen SIG," and many more.

The articles on GEOSPASIALIS are written in Indonesian and can be accessed through [www.geospasialis.com](https://geospasialis.com).
