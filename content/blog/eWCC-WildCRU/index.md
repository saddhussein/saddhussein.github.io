Over the last two years, I've found joy in engaging with webinars and online courses. Unfortunately, many of them fell short and didn't reach completion.

Amidst the partial completions, one shining achievement stands out: the e-WCC 2018 (eLearning Wildlife Conservation Course). This online course, focusing on wildlife conservation, was offered by WildCRU (Wildlife Conservation Research Unit) at the University of Oxford.

I successfully navigated the course, gaining valuable insights and knowledge in the field of wildlife conservation.

Beyond the course content, I gleaned a multitude of insights and knowledge throughout my learning journey. The experience went beyond the structured materials, providing a rich and immersive learning environment that expanded my understanding in various aspects.

## WildCRU e-WCC Overview

The e-WCC stands as an online iteration of the Postgraduate Diploma in International Wildlife Conservation Practice, crafted by Dr. Lucy Tallents and Dr. Cedric Tan.

Initiated in 2016, the course has evolved, encompassing a broader range of modules and employing diverse teaching methods. Its primary audience comprises conservation biologists from Asia, particularly those in the early or mid-stages of their careers.

Running from October 22, 2018, to January 28, 2019, the course demands an estimated commitment of 4 hours per week. To enroll, prospective participants submit a video detailing their conservation background, experiences, and aspirations for the course, with a concise limit of one minute.

Dr. Cedric Tan utilizes the course for studying the efficacy of the teaching methods he has implemented, adding an additional layer of educational research to this comprehensive learning experience.

## Application Journey

Upon learning about the opportunity through the office WhatsApp group, my interest was immediately piqued.

Crafting a 58-second video for my data processing journey was a swift task, but the editing process stretched on for hours—talk about irony!

The primary challenge lay in the one-minute duration limit for the video. To fit my narrative within this constraint, I had to artfully condense and repeat my words.

Excitement ensued when my registration was accepted—yeay!

The subsequent step was payment, albeit the course itself was cost-free. However, a deposit of 50 poundsterling (approximately 930 thousand rupiah) was required upfront as a course commitment.

This deposit would be reimbursed upon successful completion of the course, achieving a score of > 50 in each module, and would also secure a certificate. I smoothly navigated the payment process by asking a friend with pounds to assist.

Following a successful payment, I willingly filled out a form, volunteering to be a research subject for the course's development. Participants had the choice to opt in or out; I chose to participate.

This commitment involved periodic completion of questionnaires assessing the effectiveness of the learning process after each module.

The journey continued with a warm welcome from Dr. Cedric Tan, the course's designer and primary instructor. From my interactions with Cedric, I discovered a friendly, expressive individual with a great sense of humor, enhancing the overall learning experience.

## Course Content Breakdown

The e-WCC curriculum is structured around three skill groups:

#### Research Skills:

- Conservation Research: the scientific process
- Survey and experimental design

#### Analytical Skills:

- Statistical analysis using R
- Spatial analysis using QGIS
- Occupancy (habitat use)
- Population viability analysis (PVA)
- Captur-mark-recapture/ CMR (density analysis)

Participants choose two modules from Occupancy, PVA, and CMR.

#### Communication Skills:

- Presentation skills
- Creating videos
- Creating games

Participants choose between creating videos and creating games.Ic chose Creating Games.

## Overview of the learning process at e-WCC

The course is conducted on the Canvas platform, offering an array of features that facilitate the learning process. The flexible course schedule unfolds gradually, with modules unlocking according to a predetermined schedule.

Each module has an estimated completion time of 4 hours per week, with deadlines for main and additional tasks.

While participants are urged to adhere to these deadlines, there's provision for those who need additional time. At the end of the module or the course, participants can revisit materials, reattempt assignments, albeit with a penalty to the material's value.

The e-WCC platform encourages self-paced learning, allowing participants to adjust their course speed according to their individual pace. Assignments and readings are typically tackled on Saturday mornings in my case.

## Teaching Method Insights

One aspect I admire about this course is its systematic, creative, varied, effective, and transparent teaching methods.

#### Systematic:
The course kickstarts by refining research, analytical, and communication skills, presenting a clear curriculum 'storyline' from start to finish.

Each module is well-organized, offering a clear roadmap of the curriculum's progression. Symbols like A (assignment), C (challenge), D (discussion), L (lecture), P (page), Q (quiz), and V (video) efficiently categorize various activities within modules.

After an explanation of the existing activities, tips and passing grades are given that must be achieved to get a certain predicate, according to the value obtained. This explanation is summarized in the "How to achieve success" page which is made unique in each module.

#### Creative:
Dr. Cedric and his team have done an excellent job in designing this course.

They exhibit creativity by incorporating different scenarios into each module.

The story or storyline in each module is made different, for example in the fourth module we become a football coach, or in the module: Creating Games, we are assumed to be struggling from a noob gamer to a professional gamer.

{{< figure src="https://sf.ezoiccdn.com/ezoimgfmt/geospasialis.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ewcc4-1.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:703x618/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" alt="eLearning Wildlife Conservation Course" caption="Example of how success were measured" >}}

Initially perceived as slightly childish, these scenarios turned out to be engaging and effective, preventing monotony.

#### Variative:
The course employs diverse teaching methods, including
- video lectures,
- interactive videos,
- supplementary materials,
- software tutorials.

Among the methods above, interactive video lectures in my opinion are very effective.

This method imitates the face-to-face lecture process where the teacher, in the middle of the teaching process can provide a short quiz that must be answered.

In practice, in the video lecture, questions are inserted in the form of multiple-choice quizzes that we must directly answer, before the video can be continued again.

Every time we finish answering, our answer is evaluated as true and wrong. Then, an explanation of the answer to the question is given.

Various task types were also included:
- Active discussion
- Brief report
- Review articles, videos or podcasts.
- Answering the question
- Take direct measurements.
- Completing the tutorial
- Make a poster
- Collaborative flowchart
- Make a presentation video
- Make a collaborative short story
- Make a comic
- Create an avatar
- Make imaginary species
- Make games

Some results of the assignments are:

#### Effective:
The variety of task types is strategically placed, enhancing the learning process.

Tasks align directly with the relevant material, such as creating a poster after learning about poster design or inventing an imaginary species following a lesson on environmental factors in Species Distribution Modelling.

Completing tutorials with intentionally placed errors proves highly effective for practicing R programming syntax.

#### Transparent:
Each module's tasks and their respective weights are transparently outlined, enabling strategic planning when time is limited.

This transparency empowers participants to prioritize tasks based on their weights, ensuring a well-thought-out approach to completing the course successfully.

## What's in it for Me? Unpacking the e-WCC Experience

Sure, new knowledge and experience are the usual suspects, but let's delve into the specifics.

#### 1. Research Mastery:

Kicked off with the basics of the scientific thought process, research proposals, and the significance of conservation.

Equipped with skills for planning research and surveys, including sampling techniques and experimental design.

#### 2. Analytical Prowess:

Delved into the realm of open-source tools with QGIS and R for spatial analysis, Occupancy modeling, Capture-Mark-Recapture, and Population Viability Analysis (PVA).

Not just about ticking boxes; it's about honing R skills while having a go at real-world conservation problems.

#### 3. Communication Ninja:

Moved beyond number crunching to articulate findings through reports, posters, oral presentations, and videos.
Mastered the art of conveying complex research in a way that speaks to everyone.

#### 4. Game On:

The finale throws you into the exciting world of game development.

Yes, you read that right.

I, for one, crafted a board game simulating the security process in a national park. A fun challenge that tested logic and creativity.

## Pros: How Online Courses Should Be:

Creativity is the secret sauce.

Unlike other courses that left me yawning halfway, the e-WCC keeps things interesting. Scenarios in each module, coupled with a reward system, turn learning into an adventure.

It's a comprehensive package. No need to hop around from course to course; it's all here—from research basics to spatial analysis and beyond.

The deposit system is genius. Losing almost a million rupiah if I bail?

That's motivation right there.

## Cons: The Group Tango and Time Tussle:

Group tasks are a hurdle.

Schedules clash, discussions become elusive, and the canvas platform isn't exactly group-friendly. Maybe a more flexible communication avenue could solve this.

Time intensity is real.

Balancing the course with daily responsibilities is like riding a roller coaster. Some tasks demand a chunk of weekend time, and the estimated 4-hour weekly commitment? A tad optimistic. Overtime becomes the norm, and sometimes, sleep becomes a luxury.

Requests for deadline extensions aren't rare, indicating a collective need for more time.

In a nutshell, the e-WCC is a gem that stands out in the realm of online courses. It's not without its challenges, but the creative design, comprehensive curriculum, and a dash of pressure from the deposit system make it a winner in my book.

## The Graduation Saga: A Bump in the Road

So, here's the kicker...

{{< figure src="https://sf.ezoiccdn.com/ezoimgfmt/geospasialis.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ewcc8-1.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:703x508/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" alt="eWCC by WildCRU 2019" >}}

I didn't graduate.

The certificate seemed like a distant dream, and my money was teetering on the edge of no return.

Panic mode activated.

I couldn't wrap my head around it. I thought I aced the course, scoring well above 50 percent in everything. But, oh, the twist in the tale.

Upon meticulous grade-checking, I realized my remedial scores hadn't made it into the final tally. A quick confirmation with Cedric, and the waiting game began.

Then came the email – my remedial scores were in.

{{< figure src="https://geospasialis.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ewcc9-1.jpg" alt="eWCC by WildCRU 2019" caption="I graduated." >}}

Plot twist: I graduated!

Relief flooded in, my certificate finally materialized, and my money found its way back home.

After three months of an intense, rollercoaster-like course, I reveled in the satisfaction of completion.

And the icing on the cake?

Only **24 out of 80** participants made it to the finish line.

## Closing Thoughts: The eWCC Odyssey

eWCC, oh, you were nothing like I envisioned. In a good way.

This wasn't the casual stroll-through kind of online course where you could drop out whenever you pleased.

No, this was a marathon.
