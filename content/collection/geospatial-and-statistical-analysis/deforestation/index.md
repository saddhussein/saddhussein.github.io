### Deforestation Monitoring and Modeling
![Deforestation monitoring](deforestation.gif)

By overlaying forest classes from multi-temporal land cover maps, changes from forest to non-forest classes (deforestation) can be monitored. I further modeled:
- Spatial patterns of deforestation (hotspots and cold spots)
- Deforestation risk through statistical modeling such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
- Deforestation prediction using logistic regression and cellular automata modeling.
