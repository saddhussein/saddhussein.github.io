### Occupancy Analysis
![zoning](occupancy.gif)

Occupancy analysis using hierarchical modeling to account for detection error by observers makes this analysis robust and widely applied in wildlife conservation. I conducted occupancy modeling using spatial replicates (survey data, tracks) and temporal replicates (camera trap data). The result of this modeling is the species occupancy level in specific areas. By applying the model output to spatial data, habitat use can be modeled.
