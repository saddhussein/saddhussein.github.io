### Land cover/ use classification and change
![Remote sensing classification](rs-classification.gif)

From mapping using Landsat imagery to aerial photography, from simple multispectral classification to Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and integration with machine learning, from commercial software like ArcGIS and Envi to open sources platform like Google Earth Engine and R programming, I have undertaken land cover/use classification from remote sensing imagery.

By performing multi-temporal image classification and comparing the results, accurate monitoring of land cover changes can be achieved.
