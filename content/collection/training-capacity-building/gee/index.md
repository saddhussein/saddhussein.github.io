### Google Earth Engine Workshop Indonesia (Jakarta, 2019)
On Thursday and Friday, August 29-30, 2019, I had the fortunate opportunity to attend a GEE (Google Earth Engine) workshop. The workshop took place at the Google Indonesia office and was conducted by instructors from Google Asia, namely Tomomi Matsuoka, Yasushi Onda, and Katherine from Google Indonesia. The workshop was attended by approximately 40-50 participants who had gone through a selection process two months prior.

During the training, I learned the following:
- Accessing geospatial imagery and other data.
- Applying algorithms to the data.
- Filtering data collections.
- Applying algorithms to data collections.
- Reducing data collections using statistical measures such as mean, median, and other algorithms.
- Computing statistics or aggregating data.

We used GEE for several basic applications, including:
- Infrastructure - Calculating "night lights" using image statistics.
- Agriculture - Identifying paddy fields using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and LSWI (Land Surface Water Index).
- Forestry - Quantifying deforestation using image masking and statistics.
- Infection - Risk mapping - Practicing data uploading.
- Disaster prevention - Risk mapping - Practicing raster algebra.

This training provided me with a foundation of knowledge. Using these fundamentals, I have developed my skills in using GEE for my work.
