### Data wrangling and summarization using the dplyr package in R
I provided this training to the internal organization in 2019. I developed the training modules and instructed participants on using the tidyverse package, particularly dplyr to perform data wrangling and summarization tasks in R.

In this training, I explained how to select, filter, summarize, and join data using the pipe function. This training was part of a basic statistics program.
