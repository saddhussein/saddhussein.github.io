### Land cover change and deforestation analysis using remote sensing and GIS
As part of my work, I served as the lead trainer for training sessions on land cover change and deforestation analysis using remote sensing and GIS. These sessions were conducted for various institutions, including:
- Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park Authority (Bandar Lampung, Feb 2023),
- Aceh Natural Resources Conservation Agency (Banda Aceh, Dec 2022),
- Gunung Leuser National Park Authority (Medan, Sept 2022), and
- Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park Authority (Manado, Sep 2022).

In addition to being a trainer, I developed the curriculum and training modules.

During the intensive 5-day training, I provided explanations on the process of land cover change analysis, including:
- basic remote sensing theory
- land cover vs land use
- visual interpretation of remote sensing images
- basic of digital remote sensing image processing
- accuracy assessment
- post classification comparison for change detection

I also instructed participants on using softwares, tools and techniques such as:
- access, filter, manage, summarize, and export large datasets of remote sensing images using Google Earth Engine,
- build, test and execute machine learning models in R using RStudio,
- manipulate, edit, analyze and manage data in ArcGIS Desktop.

After completing this training, participants were able to perform land cover change and deforestation analysis using remote sensing and GIS in their respective areas of work, as evidenced by the completion of reports or written documents. Furthermore, post-training, I provided mentoring and assistance throughout the analysis process.
