Enhancing skills and knowledge through training and mentoring has played a crucial role in shaping my professional growth. I have a strong dedication to capacity building because I firmly believe that widespread understanding and application of data and geospatial analysis can foster a harmonious balance between humanity, the environment, and development.

Within this section, I will highlight notable accomplishments from my experiences as both a trainer and a trainee.

### Trainer
As a trainer, I strive to create engaging and interactive learning experiences, ensuring that participants gain practical skills that they can apply in their professional endeavors. I believe in fostering a collaborative and supportive environment, encouraging participants to ask questions, share their experiences, and actively participate in the training sessions.
