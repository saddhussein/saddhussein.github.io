### Basic and advanced GIS
I have been extensively involved in GIS training, particularly basic GIS, both as a lead trainer and co-trainer since my final years as a student. I have taught GIS using software such as ArcGIS Desktop (9.x and 10.x versions) and QGIS.

Some of my recent GIS training engagements include:

- Basic GIS training for staff members of Way Kambas National Park Authority (Way Jepara, 2022)
- In-House Training: Advanced GIS for staff members of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park Authority (Kotaagung, 2019)
- Basic GIS training for staff members of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park Authority and partner institutions (Gisting, 2018)

For basic GIS training, participants learned how to input spatial data from GPS or existing shapefiles, perform basic editing and analysis, symbolization, and map layouting, with the final deliverable being aesthetically pleasing and effective maps that communicate their intended purposes.
