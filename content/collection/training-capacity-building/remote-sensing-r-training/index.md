### Remote sensing image processing using R
During the pandemic in 2021, I collaborated with [G Laboratory](https://laboratoryofg.com) to conduct a live online training on basic remote sensing image processing using R. In this training, I served as the lead trainer and developed the training modules.

After completing this training, participants were able to understand and perform tasks such as importing and managing remote sensing data, image correction, creating image indices, conducting multispectral classification, and calculating classification accuracy. All processes were done using the R language.
