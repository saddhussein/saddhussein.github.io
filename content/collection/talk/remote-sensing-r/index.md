#### [Remote Sensing Image Processing in R at Lab G (2021)](https://laboratoryofg.com/basic-r-landing/)

[In this event](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLZhFHbj1cr/), I delivered training related to remote sensing image processing using R. The topics I covered included the installation of R, script writing, and the basics of R, up to its application for remote sensing image analysis: correction, index creation, classification, and accuracy testing.
