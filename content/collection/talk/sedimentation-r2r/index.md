### Sedimentation Analysis using R2R approach at Bolang Mongondow Selatan (2022)

The workshop was organized by the Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD) of Bolsel Regency with the support of the North Sulawesi Natural Resources Conservation Agency (Balai KSDA Sulut) and WCS-IP. The event took place at Hotel Sutan Raja Kotamobagu on March 14-15, 2022, and was attended by 78 participants.

As the main speaker, I presented the findings of my study titled "Analysis of Sedimentation Distribution from Land to Sea Using the Ridge-to-Reef Approach" to the Regent and Vice Regent, along with the governmental staff within the South Bolaang Mongondow Regency administration.

This presentation covered the analysis of sedimentation using remote sensing and GIS, and you can find more details in this link.
