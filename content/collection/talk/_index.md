In this section, I am excited to share with you some of the talks I have given throughout my career. These experiences have allowed me to engage with fellow professionals, share my insights, and contribute to the knowledge in my field.

I have had the privilege of speaking at various conferences, seminars, and events. Each talk has been an opportunity for me to dive deeper into important topics and share my expertise with a wider audience. I will provide you with a glimpse into the titles, event details, and key takeaways from each of these talks.

### Implementation of Geospatial Technology for Wildlife Conservation at [CircleGeo](https://www.instagram.com/circlegeo/) (2021)

Representing WCS Indonesia Program, in the webinar titled "Implementation of Geospatial Technology for Wildlife Conservation" (in Bahasa Indonesia), I shared my experiences in applying technology and geospatial analysis in the field of wildlife conservation.

The webinar, which took place on December 21, 2021, can be viewed in its recorded form through this [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6haMX_zrcM&ab_channel=CirclegeoMedia).

### Indonesia Biogeography Class at University of Indonesia (2021)

I was invited as a guest lecturer for the Biogeography course at the Graduate School of the University of Indonesia on September 20, 2021. The master's and PhD students were attentive as I presented on the topic "Geographic Information Systems in Wildlife Conservation" (in Bahasa Indonesia).

During the presentation, I explained the fundamentals of data, analysis, and geospatial technology such as GIS, remote sensing, and GPS, and how they can be used in the study and research of Biogeography and biology in general. I emphasized the importance of understanding the subjects being studied, including biological phenomena, behavior, and characteristics of specific species, when applying geospatial analysis.

There were interesting discussions sparked by audience questions, including topics such as modeling the distribution of microorganisms and the use of drones for wildlife mapping.

### Analysis of Ecosystem Class at Institut Teknologi Bandung (2021)

[School of Life Sciences and Technology (SITH) ITB](https://sith.itb.ac.id/) gave me the opportunity to share in the Ecosystem Analysis class. In this graduate-level class, I shared my knowledge and experience in conducting geospatial modeling to support wildlife conservation. I covered various topics, including an overview of geospatial technology and modeling, as well as examples of their applications in wildlife conservation.

During the discussion session, some participants asked questions. One question that sparked an interesting discussion in the class was about modeling the distribution of a specific freshwater fish species. This topic was intriguing because it involved the dynamics of the species' characteristics and its habitat, particularly in flowing rivers.

### Lisat International Symposium (2018)

I presented the findings of my study, conducted together with my colleagues from WCS-IP and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, at The 5th International Symposium on LAPAN-IPB Satellite for Food Security and Environmental Monitoring 2018 (LISAT-FSEM 2018).

I delivered a presentation titled "Land use change and deforestation monitoring in Bukit Barisan National Park using Multitemporal Landsat Data."

### Temporal and Spatial Analysis of Threats in Gunung Leuser National Park and its Surrounding Areas (2022)

This technical report presents the results of spatial and temporal analysis of threats from illegal activities in Gunung Leuser National Park. Using data from monitoring patrols conducted by rangers from 2014-2018, we applied Maximum Entropy (Phillips et al., 2006) modeling to predict the occurrence of each illegal activity and used niche overlap (Muscarella et al., 2014) to synthesize all threats. We also modeled the risk of threats from surrounding villages using an overlay modeling approach. The analysis results were used to generate a distribution of threat levels, which were then used to prioritize patrol activities in specific areas.

### Monitoring Changes in Forest Cover in Rawa Singkil Wildlife Reserve and Surrounding Areas, 2000-2019 (2021)

The report on forest cover changes and deforestation in the Rawa Singkil Wildlife Reserve (SM Rawa Singkil) and its surrounding areas provides a general overview of positive forest cover changes in relation to conservation efforts. Although there has been an increase in deforestation rates in the past, the observed deforestation rate has decreased compared to previous years.

### Monitoring Changes in Forest Cover in Gunung Leuser National Park and Surrounding Areas, 2000-2017 (2019)

This book provides an overview of the current speed and location of deforestation in Gunung Leuser National Park (GLNP) and its surrounding areas, serving as a baseline for future information updates. It also provides information on the deforestation status in each resort. This information will greatly assist in the management process at the resort level through the Resort-based Management (RBM) approach, which is also a commitment of GLNP.

### Monitoring Changes in Forest Cover in the Bukit Barisan Selatan Landscape, 2000-2017 (2019)

This report presents various important findings that reflect the impact of various area management interventions in the Bukit Barisan Selatan landscape. Besides serving as an objective record of management, we also hope that this report can serve as a reference for policy design and decision-making by the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park Agency as the area's stakeholder, thus contributing positively to improving the effectiveness of area management. Ultimately, with more effective area management, TNBBS and its partners can address various future management challenges.

### Aum! Atlas Harimau Nusantara (2019)

In the book that provides a comprehensive explanation of Tigers in Indonesia, including their physical characteristics and habitat, spatial distribution, historical and current status, and conservation plans, I served as a co-cartographer who prepared several maps for the book.
