In this section, I am excited to share with you some of the talks I have given throughout my career. These experiences have allowed me to engage with fellow professionals, share my insights, and contribute to the knowledge in my field.

I have had the privilege of speaking at various conferences, seminars, and events. Each talk has been an opportunity for me to dive deeper into important topics and share my expertise with a wider audience. I will provide you with a glimpse into the titles, event details, and key takeaways from each of these talks.
