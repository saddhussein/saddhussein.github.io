#### Lisat International Symposium (2018)

I presented the findings of my study, conducted together with my colleagues from WCS-IP and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, at The 5th International Symposium on LAPAN-IPB Satellite for Food Security and Environmental Monitoring 2018 (LISAT-FSEM 2018).

I delivered a presentation titled "Land use change and deforestation monitoring in Bukit Barisan National Park using Multitemporal Landsat Data."
