### Indonesia Biogeography Class at University of Indonesia (2021)

I was invited as a guest lecturer for the Biogeography course at the Graduate School of the University of Indonesia on September 20, 2021. The master's and PhD students were attentive as I presented on the topic "Geographic Information Systems in Wildlife Conservation" (in Bahasa Indonesia).

During the presentation, I explained the fundamentals of data, analysis, and geospatial technology such as GIS, remote sensing, and GPS, and how they can be used in the study and research of Biogeography and biology in general. I emphasized the importance of understanding the subjects being studied, including biological phenomena, behavior, and characteristics of specific species, when applying geospatial analysis.

There were interesting discussions sparked by audience questions, including topics such as modeling the distribution of microorganisms and the use of drones for wildlife mapping.
