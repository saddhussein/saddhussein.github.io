#### [Spatial Talk: GEOBIA at Lab G (2021)](https://laboratoryofg.com/spatial-talk-2-landing/)

Lab G invited me to give a talk about Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA). During [this event](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKGNaSTDKwL/), I explained the utilization of GEOBIA in remote sensing image processing. The topics I covered included the background of the emergence of GEOBIA, the basic theory of GEOBIA, and the use of GEOBIA in various applications. Towards the end of the session, I also provided a brief demo on how to perform GEOBIA using eCognition Developer.
