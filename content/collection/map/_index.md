Map production is part of my daily work. I have created hundreds of maps to assist the organization I work for in presenting data and information clearly and effectively. The maps I have produced are included in project proposals, donor reports, and displayed on office walls as practical tools for planning and evaluating activities, as well as visually appealing decorations.

One of my notable map-making projects was for the book ["Aum! Atlas Harimau Nusantara"](https://harimaukita.or.id/aum-atlas-harimau-nusantara/), where I served as a co-cartographer.
