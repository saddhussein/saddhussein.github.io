### Temporal and Spatial Analysis of Threats in Gunung Leuser National Park and its Surrounding Areas (2022)

This technical report presents the results of spatial and temporal analysis of threats from illegal activities in Gunung Leuser National Park. Using data from monitoring patrols conducted by rangers from 2014-2018, we applied Maximum Entropy (Phillips et al., 2006) modeling to predict the occurrence of each illegal activity and used niche overlap (Muscarella et al., 2014) to synthesize all threats. We also modeled the risk of threats from surrounding villages using an overlay modeling approach. The analysis results were used to generate a distribution of threat levels, which were then used to prioritize patrol activities in specific areas.

### Monitoring Changes in Forest Cover in Rawa Singkil Wildlife Reserve and Surrounding Areas, 2000-2019 (2021)

The report on forest cover changes and deforestation in the Rawa Singkil Wildlife Reserve (SM Rawa Singkil) and its surrounding areas provides a general overview of positive forest cover changes in relation to conservation efforts. Although there has been an increase in deforestation rates in the past, the observed deforestation rate has decreased compared to previous years.

### Monitoring Changes in Forest Cover in Gunung Leuser National Park and Surrounding Areas, 2000-2017 (2019)

This book provides an overview of the current speed and location of deforestation in Gunung Leuser National Park (GLNP) and its surrounding areas, serving as a baseline for future information updates. It also provides information on the deforestation status in each resort. This information will greatly assist in the management process at the resort level through the Resort-based Management (RBM) approach, which is also a commitment of GLNP.

### Monitoring Changes in Forest Cover in the Bukit Barisan Selatan Landscape, 2000-2017 (2019)

This report presents various important findings that reflect the impact of various area management interventions in the Bukit Barisan Selatan landscape. Besides serving as an objective record of management, we also hope that this report can serve as a reference for policy design and decision-making by the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park Agency as the area's stakeholder, thus contributing positively to improving the effectiveness of area management. Ultimately, with more effective area management, TNBBS and its partners can address various future management challenges.

### Aum! Atlas Harimau Nusantara (2019)

In the book that provides a comprehensive explanation of Tigers in Indonesia, including their physical characteristics and habitat, spatial distribution, historical and current status, and conservation plans, I served as a co-cartographer who prepared several maps for the book.
