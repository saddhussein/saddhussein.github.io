#### Monitoring Changes in Forest Cover in the Bukit Barisan Selatan Landscape, 2000-2017 (2019)

This report presents various important findings that reflect the impact of various area management interventions in the Bukit Barisan Selatan landscape. Besides serving as an objective record of management, we also hope that this report can serve as a reference for policy design and decision-making by the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park Agency as the area's stakeholder, thus contributing positively to improving the effectiveness of area management. Ultimately, with more effective area management, TNBBS and its partners can address various future management challenges.
