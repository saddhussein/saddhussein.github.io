#### Monitoring Changes in Forest Cover in Gunung Leuser National Park and Surrounding Areas, 2000-2017 (2019)

This book provides an overview of the current speed and location of deforestation in Gunung Leuser National Park (GLNP) and its surrounding areas, serving as a baseline for future information updates. It also provides information on the deforestation status in each resort. This information will greatly assist in the management process at the resort level through the Resort-based Management (RBM) approach, which is also a commitment of GLNP.

The book can be found and read [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338448072_MONITORING_PERUBAHAN_TUTUPAN_HUTAN_DI_KAWASAN_TAMAN_NASIONAL_GUNUNG_LEUSER_DAN_SEKITARNYA_PERIODE_2000-2017).
