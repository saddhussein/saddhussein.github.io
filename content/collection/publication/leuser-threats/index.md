#### Temporal and Spatial Analysis of Threats in Gunung Leuser National Park and its Surrounding Areas (2022)

This technical report presents the results of spatial and temporal analysis of threats from illegal activities in Gunung Leuser National Park. Using data from monitoring patrols conducted by rangers from 2014-2018, we applied Maximum Entropy (Phillips et al., 2006) modeling to predict the occurrence of each illegal activity and used niche overlap (Muscarella et al., 2014) to synthesize all threats. We also modeled the risk of threats from surrounding villages using an overlay modeling approach. The analysis results were used to generate a distribution of threat levels, which were then used to prioritize patrol activities in specific areas.
